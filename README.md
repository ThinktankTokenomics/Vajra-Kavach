# Vajra-Kavach
Vajra Kavach is a decentralized insurance solution that uses oracles to collect real-time weather data. When specific weather conditions are met, its smart contract automatically triggers the payout and transfers the funds directly to the farmer’s account — eliminating corruption, manipulation, and long delays.
