                   Vajra Kavach – Decentralized Weather Insurance for Farmers
                   
A blockchain-powered insurance system that ensures transparency, speed, and trust for India’s farmers.


                          🚩 Problem with Traditional Crop Insurance
Slow Claims: Farmers often wait 3–6 months for payouts after weather damage.
Lack of Transparency: Middlemen and paperwork lead to delays and corruption.
Limited Trust: Many farmers don’t trust existing government or private schemes due to inconsistent results.

                         ✅ Our Solution: Blockchain-Based Weather Insurance
Vajra Kavach is a demo application that uses smart contracts, real-time weather oracles, and blockchain verification to automate and improve the crop insurance process.

                            💡 Key Features
🔗 Smart Contracts: Automatically handle policies, trigger payouts based on conditions.
☁️ Oracle Integration: Pulls real-time weather data (e.g., rainfall, drought) from trusted sources.
💰 Instant Payouts: Eligible claims are settled within minutes, not months.
🔍 Transparent System: All policy and claim data is verifiable on-chain.
📱 User-Friendly Interface: Simple bilingual UI (English + Hindi) for farmers.
🧠 Yield Optimization (Future): Premiums can be staked to generate passive income, increasing sustainability.

                              🧪 Demo Workflow
Connect Wallet: Farmers must install MetaMask and connect to the Sepolia Testnet.
Select a Plan: Choose from Basic, Standard, or Premium coverage based on land area and crop type.
